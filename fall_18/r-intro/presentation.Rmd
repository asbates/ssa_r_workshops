## What This Workshop Is Not

> - The typical introduction to a programming language
> - This is a list of the basic R data types
> - This is how to create a vector ...
> - This is how to create a matrix ...
> - ...


## What This Workshop Is 

> - A simple data analysis using
> - R: the R language itself
> - RStudio: an IDE for the R language
> - R Markdown: a tool that makes mixing analysis and text easy


## Why?

>  - Being able to create a vector doesn't mean you can make a plot
>  - Being able to create a matrix doesn't mean you can fit a model

> - This workshop is more practical because
>     - You need to be able to take what you learn here and actually apply it
>     - You need to write up your analysis for it to be useful
>     - Using R with RStudio and R Markdown makes this seamless
